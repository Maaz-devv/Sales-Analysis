# Executive Summary

After reviewing **NeoNestâ€™s monthly performance metrics**, the dashboard reveals a total of **4.58M** in **Sales** across **1,000 Orders**, highlighting consistent customer demand for **electronics, fashion, and home goods**. However, two metrics stand out as potential concerns:

- **Shipped % (50.80)** vs. **Returned % (49.20):** Nearly half of all processed orders are returned, indicating potential mismatches in product expectations, quality issues, or fulfillment delays.
- **Quantity Sold (Shipped): 992:** While demand remains steady, a high volume of returned products could be eroding net shipments and profit margins.

The **monthly line chart** provides a time-based perspective of these five KPIsâ€”**Sales, Orders, Returned %, Shipped %, and Quantity Sold**â€”offering a clear view of how each metric fluctuates month over month. Meanwhile, the **bar chart** at the bottom highlights **Total Sales by Category**, allowing quick identification of top-performing segments (e.g., **Electronics & Accessories, Fashion & Apparel, and Home & Kitchen**).

On the right, a **product-level table** details each itemâ€™s **category, price, shipped and returned figures, as well as contribution to total sales**. This granular view shows which products drive the bulk of revenueâ€”and which may be contributing heavily to returns.

Interactive **city slicers** on the left and a **date slicer** on the top right enable focused analysis by region or specific time periods, making it easier to isolate where (and when) returns spike or sales surge.
